PEBBLE VERBOSE WATCHFACE
------------------------

If you own a Pebble smartwatch you are probably a little nerd and you will like this terminal-inspred watchface, displaying in a single screen a bunch of data without annoying you with useless graphics or cool typography.

My Verbose Watchface displays in a 144x168 Pebble window all the following informations:

- 24 hours clock
- 12 hours clock
- Seconds
- Date
- Weekday
- Yearly week number
- Yearly day number
- Watchface uptime
- BlueTooth connection status
- Battery level %
- Temperature and conditions for your location (data from openweathermap.org) updated every 30 miniutes.

Here on GitHub you can see the full code of the project.
